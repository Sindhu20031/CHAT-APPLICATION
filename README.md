# CHAT-APPLICATION
My chat application follows a client-server architecture. The server listens for incoming connections from the client. Once connected, the server and client communicate using sockets. The client sends messages to the server, which broadcasts them back to the client. Each message is displayed in a GUI built with Java Swing.
